# Order & Package Tracking Assistant

The **Order & Package Tracking Assistant** is a simple web-based chatbot application that allows users to:
- View their recent orders.
- Check order details by providing an order number (e.g., ORD123).
- Track packages by providing a tracking number (e.g., TRK123456).

The assistant uses sample order and package data to simulate interactions and provide responses.

## Features
- **Track Orders**: Retrieve details about orders, including items, total amount, and shipping information.
- **Track Packages**: Check the current status, location, and estimated delivery date of a package.
- **Guided Support**: Provides users with help and instructions to interact with the chatbot.
